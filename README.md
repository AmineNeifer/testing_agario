### Short Story!

The idea of our project was a game, but not just any game it was the clone of the famous agario game, but the twist we wanted to make was making it the Tunisian version, adding Tunisian instruments as the SFX, making custom skins such as the Chachiya and making it funny and adding some quests and missions to-do so that the players won’t find it boring. Me and my team mate Amine split the roles, he would focus on making the graphics and what the player would see when entering the game which was made with P5 JS and I did the Socket.io which is a JS library for realtime web applications. and that was basically it aside from some CSS and HTML which were more than basic and weren’t a big issue as the JS libraries we used!
